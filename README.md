list out all batsmen , bowlers profile and other important stats using ball by ball raw data from 2008-2020 ipl

Please go through the below guidelines before looking into deliverable files for easy understanding.

Two Input files were placed in the below zip file namely (IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv and ipl part 2.xlsx)

For easy identification of five outputs, I have attached the output tools for all the five outputs in the workflow so that you can identify , remove and rerun the workflow.

The file name "Batsman Output" gives all the statistics about batsmen.

The file name "Bowling output" gives all the statistics about bowlers.

The file name "All rounders Output" gives both batting and bowling statistics of the respective players whose economy is less than 10 and took more than 8 wickets in bowling and whose averages are greater than 20 in batting.

The file name "most catches output" gives the player name along with the number of catches they have taken.

The filename "most run outs output" gives the player name along with the number of times they got run out.
